### Introduction

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs [Whole Health approach to care](https://va.gov/wholehealth) includes a [Circle of Health](https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTH/circle-of-health/index.asp) and [Personal Health Inventory](https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTH/docs/PHI_Jan2022_Final_508.pdf) along with extensive guidance on how to implement these practices for Veterans.

This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) is derived from the [HL7 Person-Centered Outcomes (PCO) FHIR IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/pco-ig) specification.
